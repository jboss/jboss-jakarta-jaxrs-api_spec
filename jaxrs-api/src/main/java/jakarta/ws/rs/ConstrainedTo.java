/**
 * Indicates the run-time context in which an annotated provider
 * is applicable. If a {@code @ConstrainedTo} annotation is not
 * present on a provider type declaration, the declared provider
 * may be used in any run-time context. If such a annotation is present,
 * the runtime will enforce the specified usage restriction.
 * <p>
 * The following example illustrates restricting a {@link jakarta.ws.rs.ext.MessageBodyReader}
 * provider implementation to run only as part of a {@link RuntimeType#CLIENT Client run-time}:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 *  &#064;ConstrainedTo(RuntimeType.CLIENT)
 *  public class MyReader implements MessageBodyReader {
 *      ...
 *  }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * The following example illustrates restricting a {@link jakarta.ws.rs.ext.WriterInterceptor}
 * provider implementation to run only as part of a {@link RuntimeType#SERVER Server run-time}:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 *  &#064;ConstrainedTo(RuntimeType.SERVER)
 *  public class MyWriterInterceptor implements WriterInterceptor {
 *      ...
 *  }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * It is a configuration error to constraint a provider implementation to
 * a run-time context in which the provider cannot be applied. In such case, the
 * runtime SHOULD inform a user about the issue and ignore the provider implementation in further
 * processing.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, the following restriction of a {@link jakarta.ws.rs.client.ClientRequestFilter}
 * to run only as part of the server run-time would be considered invalid:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 *  // reported as invalid and ignored by the runtime
 *  &#064;ConstrainedTo(RuntimeType.SERVER)
 *  public class MyFilter implements ClientRequestFilter {
 *      ...
 *  }
 * </pre>
