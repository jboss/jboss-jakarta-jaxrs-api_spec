/**
 * A feature extension contract.
 *
 * Typically encapsulates a concept or facility that involves configuration of multiple providers
 * (e.g. filters or interceptors) and/or properties.
 * <p>
 * A {@code Feature} is a special type of configuration meta-provider. Once a feature is registered,
 * its {@link #configure(FeatureContext)} method is invoked during runtime configuration and bootstrapping
 * phase allowing the feature to further configure the runtime context in which it has been registered.
 * From within the invoked {@code configure(...)} method a feature may provide additional runtime configuration
 * for the facility or conceptual domain it represents, such as registering additional contract providers,
 * including nested features and/or specifying domain-specific properties.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Features implementing this interface MAY be annotated with the {@link jakarta.ws.rs.ext.Provider &#64;Provider}
 * annotation in order to be discovered by the runtime when scanning for resources and providers.
 * Please note that this will only work for server side features. Features in the Client API must
 * be registered programmatically.
 * </p>
