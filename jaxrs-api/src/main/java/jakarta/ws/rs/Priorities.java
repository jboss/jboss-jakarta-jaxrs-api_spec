/**
 * A collection of built-in priority constants for the components that are supposed to be
 * ordered based on their {@code javax.annotation.Priority} class-level annotation value when used
 * or applied by the runtime.
 * <p>
 * For example, filters and interceptors are grouped in chains for each of the message
 * processing extension points: Pre, PreMatch, Post as well as ReadFrom and WriteTo.
 * Each of these chains is sorted based on priorities which are represented as integer numbers.
 * All chains, except Post, are sorted in ascending order; the lower the number the higher the priority.
 * The Post filter chain is sorted in descending order to ensure that response filters are executed in
 * <em>reverse order</em>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Components that belong to the same priority class (same integer value) are executed in an
 * implementation-defined manner. By default, when the {@code @Priority} annotation is absent on a component,
 * for which a priority should be applied, the {@link Priorities#USER} priority value is used.
 * </p>
