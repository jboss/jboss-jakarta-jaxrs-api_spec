/**
 * An extension interface implemented by container response filters.
 * <p>
 * By default, i.e. if no {@link jakarta.ws.rs.NameBinding name binding} is applied
 * to the filter implementation class, the filter instance is applied globally to
 * any outgoing response.
 * If there is a {@code @NameBinding} annotation applied to the filter, the filter
 * will only be executed for a response for which the request has been matched to
 * a {@link jakarta.ws.rs.HttpMethod resource or sub-resource method} AND the method
 * or the whole custom {@link jakarta.ws.rs.core.Application Application} class
 * is bound to the same name-binding annotation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implement a name-bound response filter in cases when you want limit the filter
 * functionality to a matched resource or resource method. In other cases,
 * when the filter should be applied globally to any outgoing response, implement an
 * unbound, global response filter.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Filters implementing this interface must be annotated with
 * {@link jakarta.ws.rs.ext.Provider &#64;Provider} to be discovered by the
 * runtime. Container response filter instances may also be discovered and
 * bound {@link DynamicFeature dynamically} to particular resource methods.
