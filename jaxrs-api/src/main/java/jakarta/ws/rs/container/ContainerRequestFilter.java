/**
 * An extension interface implemented by container request filters.
 * <p>
 * By default, i.e. if no {@link jakarta.ws.rs.NameBinding name binding} is applied
 * to the filter implementation class, the filter instance is applied globally,
 * however only after the incoming request has been matched to a particular resource
 * by the runtime.
 * If there is a {@link jakarta.ws.rs.NameBinding &#64;NameBinding} annotation
 * applied to the filter, the filter will also be executed at the <i>post-match</i>
 * request extension point, but only in case the matched {@link jakarta.ws.rs.HttpMethod
 * resource or sub-resource method} is bound to the same name-binding annotation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In case the filter should be applied at the <i>pre-match</i> extension point,
 * i.e. before any request matching has been performed by the runtime, the
 * filter MUST be annotated with a {@link PreMatching &#64;PreMatching} annotation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Use a pre-match request filter to update the input to the matching algorithm,
 * e.g., the HTTP method, Accept header, return cached responses etc. Otherwise,
 * the use of a request filter invoked at the <i>post-match</i> request extension point
 * (after a successful resource method matching) is recommended.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Filters implementing this interface must be annotated with
 * {@link jakarta.ws.rs.ext.Provider &#64;Provider} to be discovered by the
 * runtime. Container request filter instances may also be discovered and
 * bound {@link DynamicFeature dynamically} to particular resource methods.
